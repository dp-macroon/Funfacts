# GEN AI-101 PIESES COPILOT
The **Fun Facts Generator App** is a fun, interactive web application that generates random "fun facts" about the user. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to apply the concepts of prompt engineering, context setting, and handling AI limitations (hallucinations) learned in GenAI 101.

## Key Features
- **Random Fun Fact Generation**: Displays a random, user-defined fun fact each time you click the button.
- **Customizable Facts**: Users can personalize the app by adding their own unique facts.
- **Easy Hosting on GitHub Pages**: With no additional setup, users can deploy their app online to share with others.

### Steps:
- **Objective**: Create a fun, shareable app with "fun facts" about yourself, generated and customized using Pieces Copilot.
- **GenAI Concept**: Setting a clear project goal and prompt focus.

1. Use Pieces Copilot to generate code snippets for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple single-page app.
   - **index.html**: Provides the basic HTML structure.
   - **style.css**: Adds styling for a personalized look and feel.
   - **script.js**: Contains JavaScript to handle random fact generation and user interactions.
2. Customize the fun facts on music by modifying the facts array in `script.js`.

Example:
```javascript
const funFacts = [
            "Beethoven was completely deaf by the end of his life, yet he composed some of the most famous music.",
            "The world's largest grand piano was built by a 15-year-old in New Zealand.",
            "A group of flamingos is called a 'flamboyance'.",
            "The most expensive musical instrument ever sold is a Stradivarius violin, which sold for $16 million.",
            "The first music video played on MTV was 'Video Killed the Radio Star' by The Buggles.",
            "The longest recorded piece of music is 'As Slow As Possible' by John Cage, which lasts 639 years."
        ];
